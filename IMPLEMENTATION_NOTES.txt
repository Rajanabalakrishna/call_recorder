QUICK START COMMAND:

flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter run --release

=============================================================================

KEY FEATURES:

✅ Recording continues when app is closed
✅ Records both sides of conversation
✅ Automatic call detection
✅ Manual recording control
✅ VoIP app support (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.)
✅ Android 10-15 compatible
✅ Production quality code
✅ Google Play compliant

=============================================================================

CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION POINTS:

1. FOREGROUND SERVICE REQUIRED
   - Must start BEFORE MediaRecorder
   - Must have persistent notification
   - Must return START_STICKY
   - Type: "microphone" (NOT "phoneCall")

2. ACCESSIBILITY SERVICE REQUIRED
   - User must enable in Settings
   - Detects call state & VoIP apps
   - Triggers recording service
   - Required for Android 10+

3. AUDIO SOURCE SELECTION
   - Android 10+: VOICE_RECOGNITION (preferred)
   - Android 10+: UNPROCESSED (fallback)
   - Android 9: VOICE_COMMUNICATION
   - Choose based on device support

4. PERMISSIONS CRITICAL
   - RECORD_AUDIO (microphone access)
   - READ_PHONE_STATE (call detection)
   - FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE (FGS type)
   - POST_NOTIFICATIONS (Android 13+)
   - BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE (accessibility)

5. NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
   - Non-dismissible (setOngoing(true))
   - Shows recording status
   - Persistent during recording
   - Created BEFORE startForeground()

=============================================================================

TESTING MATRIX:

✅ MUST TEST ON:
- Android 14 (latest, easiest to fix)
- Android 10 (oldest supported)

✅ RECOMMENDED:
- Android 12 (mid-range)
- Android 13 (notification handling)

✅ OPTIONAL:
- Android 11, 15

=============================================================================
